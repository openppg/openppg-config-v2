OpenPPG X4 Controller uses WebUSB to communicate from your browser to your device.

Make sure you are using one of the [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/webusb).
We recomend Chrome.

## Get started

1. Plug the microUSB cable into your controller and connect to your PC or Android phone.
2. You may see a notification pop up from your browser. Now navigate to the [config tool](/configurators/x4/).

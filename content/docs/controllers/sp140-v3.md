## Intro

The current OpenPPG SP140 Controller is based on the ESP32 platform and uses the webserial API to communicate from your browser to your device. Supported desktop browsers are listed [here](https://caniuse.com/web-serial).

## Performance Mode

The performance mode changes the dynamics of the SP140 throttle and serves different flying styles.
"Chill" is less responsive and reduces max power to ~80%. "Sport" unlocks full power and is more sensitive to slight input changes.

We recommend flying in chill mode until you get comfortable with the instant power the OpenPPG SP140 can provide.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="You can toggle the performance mode by holding down the top button on the SP140 controller while disarmed. A beep confirms the change." />}}

### Updating firmware

New firmware can add features and improve functionality. To update the firmware on the ESP32-based controller:

1. Connect the controller to your computer via USB.
2. Use the [web-based firmware update tool](/configurators/sp140-v3/).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the update process.

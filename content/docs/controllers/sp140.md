## Intro

OpenPPG SP140 Controller uses WebUSB to communicate from your browser to your device.

Make sure you are using one of the [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/webusb).
We recomend Chrome.

## Get started

1. Plug the microUSB cable into your controller and connect to your PC or phone.
2. You may see a notification pop up from your browser. Now navigate to the [config tool](/configurators/sp140/).

## Using the SP140 Config Tool

### Units

Prefer to view your altitude in meters or feet? Simply toggle this to update the controller setting.

### Performance Mode

The performance mode changes the dynamics of the SP140 throttle and serves different flying styles.
Chill is less responsive and reduces max power to 75%. Sport unlocks full power and is more sensitive to slight input changes.

We recommend flying in chill mode until you get comfortable with the instant power the OpenPPG SP140 can provide.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="You can also toggle the performance mode without the config tool by holding down the top button on the SP140 controller while powering on. A beep confirms the change." />}}

### Updating firmware

1. Download the .uf2 firmware you wish to flash
2. With the controller connected press "reboot in update mode" to switch to the UF2 compatible bootloader. The screen will flash then turn off.
3. Drag or paste the .uf2 file onto the newly added USB drive and wait for a reboot.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="It is safe to return back to normal operating mode by simply power cycling if you decide not to update" />}}
